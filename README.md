# Keylogger

Keylogger built using C++ for ethical hacking.

I do not condone hacking for unethical reasons. 

This is a purely educational project and tool.

Thus far, I have successfully been able to test it in VirtualBox machines as well as Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.

Note: For SendMail.h to not be hindered by the spam filter, it is recommended to toggle "Less secure app access" on for the sake of testing (just don't forget to turn it back on afterwards of course!).
