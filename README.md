# Keylogger

Keylogger built using C++ for "Build an Advanced Keylogger using C++ for Ethical Hacking!" Udemy course 

Thus far, I have successfully been able to test it in VirtualBox machines as well as Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.

Note: For SendMail.h to not be hindered by the spam filter, it is recommended to toggle "Less secure app access" on for the sake of testing (just don't forget to toggle it on afterwards of course!).
